## Project Overview
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to scrape product data from Fashion Studio website (https://fashion-studio.dicoding.dev/), transform the data according to business requirements, and load it into a CSV repository.

## Features
- **Extract**: Web scraping of product data from Fashion Studio website
  - Collects Title, Price, Rating, Colors, Size, Gender
  - Includes timestamp of extraction
  - Handles pagination to extract all products

- **Transform**: Data cleaning and transformation
  - Converts USD prices to IDR (exchange rate: Rp16,000)
  - Cleans rating values to extract numerical ratings
  - Extracts numeric values from Colors field
  - Removes 'Size:' prefix from Size field
  - Removes 'Gender:' prefix from Gender field
  - Removes duplicate entries and null values
  - Removes invalid products (e.g., "Unknown Product")

- **Load**: Data storage
  - Saves transformed data to CSV file
  - Handles errors gracefully

## Implementation Details
- Modular code structure with separate modules for each ETL phase
- Comprehensive unit tests with high test coverage
- Error handling throughout the pipeline

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the ETL pipeline: `python main.py`

## Repository Choice
For this submission, I've implemented CSV storage only. The code structure supports future integration with Google Sheets and PostgreSQL, but these are not currently implemented.
